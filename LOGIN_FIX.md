# Login Redirect Bug Fix

## Problem
Users could successfully log in (showing "Welcome back!" toast), but remained stuck on the login page instead of being redirected to the dashboard.

## Root Cause
The `AuthLayout` component wasn't checking if a user was already authenticated. After login, the auth state would update asynchronously, but the LoginPage component was still rendered within the AuthLayout, which didn't know to redirect authenticated users.

## Solution

### 1. Updated `AuthLayout.tsx`
Added automatic redirect for logged-in users:

```typescript
import { Navigate, Outlet } from 'react-router-dom'
import { useAuthStore } from '@/store/authStore'

export default function AuthLayout() {
  const { user } = useAuthStore()

  // If user is already logged in, redirect to dashboard
  if (user) {
    return <Navigate to="/dashboard" replace />
  }

  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen flex items-center justify-center p-4">
      <div className="w-full max-w-md">
        <Outlet />
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### 2. Simplified `LoginPage.tsx`
Removed manual navigation since AuthLayout now handles it:

```typescript
const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
  e.preventDefault()
  setLoading(true)

  try {
    const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({
      email: formData.email,
      password: formData.password,
    })

    if (error) throw error

    if (data.session) {
      toast.success('Welcome back!')
      // AuthLayout will handle the redirect once user state updates
    }
  } catch (error: any) {
    toast.error(error.message || 'Failed to sign in')
    setLoading(false)
  }
}
```

## How It Works Now

1. User submits login form
2. Supabase authenticates user and creates session
3. `onAuthStateChange` listener in `authStore.ts` detects session change
4. Store fetches user profile from database and updates `user` state
5. `AuthLayout` detects `user` is now set
6. `AuthLayout` automatically redirects to `/dashboard`

## Benefits

✅ **Cleaner code** - No manual navigation in login page
✅ **Consistent behavior** - All auth routes now redirect authenticated users
✅ **Prevents edge cases** - Users can't access login/signup pages when logged in
✅ **Better UX** - Automatic redirect feels more natural

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Login with valid credentials → Redirects to dashboard
- [ ] Try to access `/login` when already logged in → Redirects to dashboard
- [ ] Try to access `/signup` when already logged in → Redirects to dashboard
- [ ] Sign out and access `/login` → Shows login page
- [ ] Invalid login credentials → Shows error, stays on login page
